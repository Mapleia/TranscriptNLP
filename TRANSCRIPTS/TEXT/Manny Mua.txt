how you guys how are you guys doing to day what is up um so this is super random and this is definitely my normal setup I'm in my room it's kind of a man it's fine it's fine um I kinda just wanted to make this video to just chat with you guys and just inform you how everything's been going and how I've been feeling the past couple months and I'm just gonna be just really candid and honest and upfront and just let you guys know I've been in the past couple months you know and um I had a hard time recently with my bottle of anxiety and depression and I'm just not been in the best place ever um and usually I'm the type that would like to keep all that stuff private at least although the dark side like the dark stuff the really deep dark stuff at private and just like I'm really really really feeling deep down because I want you guys to just see a strong person and yes I show you guys my weak sides of course my more vulnerable side of course but I just feel like I need to just open up to guys more and let you guys know how I've been and if I've been off in social media and things like diets just because I've just been feeling really depressed recently and I don't know what it is you know my family has a history of anxiety and depression and I think anxiety and depression my whole life I just always really talked about my anxiety and more than I talk about my depression because I tried to I just try to keep it something more hidden and I just don't want to anymore you know I want to just be super honest and upfront with you guys and let you know how I'm feeling and it's just been so hard recently and I don't know what it is and I think it's I mean I know it's the stress that I've been having from my launch and leading up to it for the months leading up to it and the bigger my stress gets the bigger my anxiety and depression gets and I'm so unmotivated and I'm so sad all the time and I'm trying to be be all the time but I can't be because I'm sad and I don't know why you know and it's just so frustrating to me because I try so hard for you guys to be like this strong person that you see all night I have millions of followers that I want to see me in the best way possible but I'm not strong all the time and I want you guys to know that it's okay to not be strong all the time too you know I feel like being vulnerable is also a sign of I'm sorry being vulnerable is also a sign of strength and you don't need to be strong or pretend to be strong all the time and if you guys are feeling sad or you guys are feeling depressed or you're feeling anxious it's okay to ask for help as well I just finished watching the second season of 13 reasons why and it just inspired me to you know make this video and just talk about my own personal struggles that I deal with and I deal with it all the time and it's a constant battle and if you struggle with anxiety and depression you know it's not something that is it's not it's not easy to deal with because you feel like there's something wrong with you but you don't know how to fix it I treat my youtube as my diary I really do and that's why we created videos for as long as I have and the reason I'm bringing this up is because I want you guys to know that you're not alone and it's so hard to struggle with depression anxiety and any other mental illness and it's not your fault whatsoever you know what anything can trigger it as well and I know I might put on a strong face and I might put on a strong show for you guys just because that's what I want for you guys and I want you guys to see someone strong and charismatic and fun and happy all the time but happy all the time and things do get to me and I try my best but it's so hard sometimes and I could be any little thing will set you often send you into a spiral you know even a hate comment online or something in real life recently I think another thing that set me off was recently and me recently and meet my family pet she passed away passed away like toots ago three weeks ago what was sudden and it really shouldn't be so hard and we had her for eight years you know she's a Yorkie she is the in the world almost nine years ago and not just sent me to a full depression yeah death is such a real thing that's what I said no that you need to be living your life it's the fullest of your ability don't let anyone stand in your way whether they like you or hate you don't let other people's opinions push you into doing what you don't want to do you don't like this too short it's too fragile and you need to be living your life yourself and I think the same thing about me I can't keep lettin people push me into something I don't want to do and I've always been that person you know I've been such a I've been such a doormat my whole life and I you just can't allow it anymore and I'm trying my hardest to be stronger for myself for you guys it for my family and I'm sorry that I'm a blubbering mess I cannot help you know when like the tears start you just getting stopped that's who I am but I just want to let you guys know and I kind of let you in a little bit on what I've been dealing with like on the inside not the outside no not with lunar beauty and not with Lysa dragon oh that's that's great and it's a beautiful and I'm so happy heart they the outcome has been I just wanna let you guys in on the inside of me as a man he not man anyway and um I also just want to say thank you guys so much for all the positivity you I send me every single day you have no idea how much it helps me and and how happy it makes me okay I'm such a mess to see me you guys uplift me so much even I know you guys don't know that and you're just sending me a comment here and there say that I've made you happy this makes me happy because it's all I want for you guys nice to be someone that you guys can look up to when someone that just tries their hardest and tries their best and I know I'm not perfect I'm so far from perfect it's not even funny I'm so far from it but I do want you guys to know what that I do try my best and the decisions I've made in the past everything the bad ones and the good ones that led to me who I am now and I feel like the person who I am now is pretty cool and pretty great but sometimes it's just hard to see when you're paddling with mental illness and depression and anxiety even today like I couldn't get that Tory know it's five o'clock because the president you motivated you don't want to do it it's still really really hard yeah um I wanted to say thank you guys and just let you in a little bit more on my everyday life yeah just say thank you so much without the positive view that you guys send me so I know of course I get negativity but it's so much more positivity from you guys and you truly have no idea how much it affects me because it really does your bosses anybody helps bless me what I don't want to be uplifted you know what I mean and I just want to say thank you guys so much and you've made me the happiest person that made me be happiest person for the constant and the constant support and I'm gonna continue to try to be better for you guys for myself nothing's gonna stop me you know I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing and I want you guys to know that even if you are dealing with mental illness you guys will get through it whether you need to make a video like me to help talk about it and have your feelings out there or you need to talk to a professional or anything like that I'll leave numbers and links down below to different sites that might help um just know that if you heard battling mental illness and having to deal with anxiety depression any other thing that you're not alone and that I love you guys so much and you guys are so strong and continue to be strong for those around you and I promise you that I will get better and yeah I'm having I'm in a hole right now I'm not right but I will get out of it no well because I believe in myself yeah I know my worth and I know I'm a good person looking out of this right but it just just takes uptight it just takes some types of tightness and um I apologize for this kind of video I really feel like I need it to make it and just stop really just talk to you guys because I've just been o holding my feelings in for months at once and once and I feel like you need to talk I just feel you need to talk about them or you're gonna burst and you're gonna do something you're gonna regret or you're gonna do something that the people around you will be if that's right forever so please just talk about your feelings and open up and just be honest with yourself and honest with others and you will notice you will notice so much positivity in your life and yeah that's it I just wanted to come in here and talk to you guys a little bit and I'm sorry if this is triggering in any way or anything like that but I just needed to do it for myself I know it's very not glamorous and not any anyway but I want to let you in wanna make me as well so thank you guys so much I love you all so so much and stay strong and I will continue to do so as well but don't forget that being vulnerable is also strength as well so guys so so much
