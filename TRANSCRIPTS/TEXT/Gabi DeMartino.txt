this video is going to touch on a very serious topic so i'd like to insert a trigger warning recently my lack of judgment and poor decisions have led to a very very serious issue that needs to be addressed i owe it to you guys as i was coming up with new ideas and new content i was watching a home video with my family of myself as a three-year-old when my mom announced that she was pregnant with my younger brother in that home video i ruined a beautiful moment by telling everyone that i heard my nanny tell me to put my panties on through a stethoscope it's a video that has brought back laughter and joy within my family for years and i shared it with what i thought was a funny caption it's not funny it was a quote from the video never in a million years did i think something that i thought was so innocent could be looked in such an ugly way and i think that's where the problem lies i've realized i'm so disattached with reality that it didn't even cross my mind that this could be viewed like this and that's a serious issue it's not funny it will never be funny and it's not okay and i'm really sorry i'm sorry to my friends my fans my family to anyone that i've heard i'm so truly sorry and it was definitely a huge lack of my character and my judgment and i know who i am in my heart and i know that if you know me you would know i would never condone anything like this so it really hurts to know the pain that i've caused for so many people my family my friends my fans my supporters even people who have just simply been triggered by my stupid thoughtless action to everyone i'm very very sorry it was very insensitive and a poor representation of who i am and what i believe in i would never do anything to exploit or harm a child i'm so sorry truly very sorry this is a huge wake-up call i'm gonna step back into reality now and i'm gonna reflect and i love you guys and i'm so sorry i'm i'm going to grow and learn from this and i will come out of this a better person and i will do better this was really wrong
