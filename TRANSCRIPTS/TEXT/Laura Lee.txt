hey guys I know I haven't been on YouTube or any social media a little over a month now I wanted to come back to YouTube with this video to talk to you guys about a couple of things first off I want to say I've missed you guys so so so much second of all I want to talk to you guys a little bit about my apology video which was the last video that I had posted on my channel and I owe you guys a sincere apology I in that video I come off more as a victim I am NOT a victim in any way form or fashion in this situation I'm taking the video down because it doesn't represent me well I am NOT taking the video down to try to hide it from you guys so pretend like it didn't happen I know the video is literally all over the internet so if you guys want to see it you totally could I'm taking it off my channel because it does not represent the human being that I am today and in the video you guys receive more reaction on the situation than you did even a response and I hope that makes sense to you guys and that is my reasoning for taking it down next I want to talk to you guys about my past in my past tweets and retweets that I had posted first off I take full responsibility for the things that I retweet it and the things that I tweet at six and a half years ago there were a couple tweets that came out that weren't real I will put the ones that are real on the screen and I am truly sorry I have changed so much as a human being in the past six and a half years I have grown so much and have gained so much knowledge and respect I know that its prejudice and stereotypes are not funny ever in any way fashion or form I know that is nothing to joke about and I understand that through the situation I have grown and I have learned so much and I'm gonna continue to learn and grow and with taking time off I took the time and thought about my positioning Who I am why I started this journey and I came to realize I literally have millions of people watching me I am a role model and I have to stand for more and I have to do a better job and I'm going to do that I want to help this whole community that right now is not in a good place to turn it around and put it in a beautiful place where it's a positive place where we come to beauty to grow together and to feel good again I want to take some responsibility for that and I want to help turn this whole community around and I know that we can do it together and I know that because whenever I was gone the amount of love I received the amount of dm's emails tweets just everything flooding in with just pure love and kindness coming from people in the beauty community influencers and and you guys yourself was just crazy and it showed me how much humanity and positivity is truly deep down in this community and I being gone did some pretty cool things to work with different people that had nothing to really do with makeup and beauty but it just had to do with growing as a human and being a good person and I want to post on my channel I hope you guys want to see that I would love to share that with you guys and throughout my channel now I would love to show more that with you guys and help to grow this community as a whole I again I love you guys so much I've missed you so much and I promise I'm gonna get back to makeup I'm gonna get back to my passion and what I love so much about YouTube and you guys thank you for taking the time out your day to watch this video and I hope to see you all in my next video bye guys
