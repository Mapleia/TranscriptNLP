hey guys what's up i just woke up and um i just want to say i took the biggest l in the history of elves like literally i messed up really bad and i just wanted to make this video to say sorry to everyone that i offended sorry to all the people that i let down and sorry that all the rape victims out there um i could have easily waited a week for this or waited tomorrow to have someone write me up something where i can say it and make it perfect because this apology won't be perfect i'm gonna leave out some stuff but at least it's genuine right and it's like people have been hating on me for like the past hour i've been reading it over and it sucks because like there's like you guys don't even know like the full truth right so before you guys hate on me everything so before you comment just watch this whole entire video and then you know have your opinions on it but yeah if you guys like ricegum what the hell are you even talking about uh if you guys don't know what happened basically there's this youtuber that hates my guts right he he hates me a lot his name is onision he's made multiple videos just attacking me uh calling me out and none of them seem to work because you know i don't know why he just been hating on me and so nothing seemed to work so today randomly he's like all right you know what let's find a clip of ricegum from a while ago before he blew up on youtube and let's show people that clip you know and let's uh take it out of context and you know cut out all the good parts and let's just make him look as bad as possible so that's exactly what he did he posted this i hate some people because they do stuff like this i told this dude no i don't want it and then like i was like drunk and then yeah and so that's why i don't really count that but why he raped you yeah i mean did you sue him and [ __ ] or not no i didn't because like i he just has a lot of family members that are like that were like oh and i got bullied like in high school like i don't know you got raped yeah bro and this this dude he raped like a hell of people oh what the [ __ ] no but did it feel good though no i didn't listen ricegum i know you struggle to be socially aware which is but yeah guys as you guys can see i am probably one of the biggest douchebags ever i literally just laughed at her and once again i think back and i'm like why did i do that but once again i am sorry just kind of funny because the person reporting this and bringing this to the public his name is onision he's pretty big on youtube two mil or whatever that's why it's kind of making a buzz but he reported on it and in the video he was like preaching about how rape is super serious and and super important and should not be joked around about you know rape is serious which i totally agree rape i mean think about it like rape is when you force someone what like you're literally just and that's so [ __ ] up and i'm just thinking like why did i laugh about that but um onis sounds over here you know preaching it and i totally agree with him but like he's such a hypocrite because on his twitter he's always making jokes about rape like like i'm not sure if he knows where i can search up his old tweets but this dude's a hypocrite but i'm not here to like point fingers at people uh because the point of the video like the objective of the video is to make you guys know that i'm sorry not to you know throw him under the bus or anything but yeah i'm sorry just kind of ironic how he's the one exposing me when he jokes about rape all the time um but yeah i'm gonna run you guys through everything right now as easy and as fast as i can okay so before i blow up on youtube i used to do this thing where i live stream right i sit there i play games live and then i tell stories i answer questions there's people watching and typing in the chat so i can interact with but this is what a live stream is right i do this uh pretty often back then i still do uh live stream quite a bit now but yeah i would sit there uh play games and answer questions and you know just like any other live stream but occasionally my viewers would just link me you know a random girl on instagram or some twitter and then i would just hit him up like hey you want to come on my livestream it's pretty funny because i would call them and we would just talk about just the random stuff so then i called this girl while i was streaming and she seemed really nice and this actually wasn't our first time talking we've talked before but yeah i'm over here playing games and we're just having a conversation and we're talking about like just normal stuff wait are you in college yeah what college uh portland state damn is lit it's kind of late it's not it's not as lit as i would like it to be though go to like parties and then out of nowhere she says okay and i'm gonna say and basically i i don't know i got raped kind of like i told this dude no i don't want it and then like i was like drunk and then yeah and so that's why i don't really count that but why he raped you yeah i mean did you sue him and [ __ ] or not no i didn't because like i he just has a lot of family members that are like that were like oh i got bullied like in high school like i don't know you got raped yeah bro and this this dude he raped like a hell of people oh what the [ __ ] no no but did it feel good though no i didn't as you guys can see by my face i was really just caught off guard and like had no idea what was going on like i was like did she really just say that in front of thousands of people because you know usually on my live streams people don't talk about that personal or like that personal type of stuff so i was like so i didn't know how to respond i didn't know what to do there so i mean i guess i was just in a weird spot and that probably explains why i said something stupid because i just didn't know what to say i was just trying to not make it silent i'm assuming i don't know um and another thing that onision did that was kind of shady because so here's the clip that onision showed see how he like cuts off the top of it so basically he was trying to hide the chat the chat so so here's the original clip right see how the chat is on the top right so those are everyone that's talking right and and see how the chat reacted to when she said it so it's pretty fast so everyone's like wtf and like what like what's going on and stuff and like it takes a while for the chat to process since it's like all live and there's the video processing so it takes like 20 seconds for the chat to actually pop up on screen but this was their reaction as soon as they heard the word rape so everyone started freaking out because it was so random and i started freaking out i didn't know what to say because once again it is live so everything i said is like saved there right i can't like think about what to say it's literally like a regular conversation live so i'm like uh i'm a cracker joke and it was the worst time to crack a joke and i probably shouldn't have said what i said i regret it and i will regret it for like the next 10 years i'll be like why did i say that and i'm sorry i'm really sorry the weird thing is after i made that joke or that rude remark you know towards her situation we kept talking like another hour of conversation happened like as if nothing happened like she wasn't affected at all by what i said it was a joke she understands that it was a joke and she just moved on and like the next day we talked i've texted her occasionally recently and so we're like you know cool and stuff so it's like so you know in my head i'm like i didn't do anything wrong and now everyone's pointing out you know and and as i re-watch the clip i'm like okay i clearly messed up i'm i'm so sorry because like looking back now that what i said was really immature and really not funny it wasn't funny at all like why make an offensive joke if it's not even funny at all like what i said was even funny right so yeah i woke up today i saw the video exposing me and the first thing in my head i wasn't even like i'mma make a video defending myself the first thing i did was i called her yo yes can you turn on your camera oh my gosh yeah yeah you just woke up yeah i just saw that is it on yeah all right what's up all right so you're probably confused or whatever but uh you remember like it was like a while ago actually but it was like you told so i was like streaming and then i called you or whatever and then you told me like that story about how like he got raped or whatever oh yeah yeah i remember yeah so it's like um i think like after you told me a story like i started laughing or you know i said something pretty like pretty rude or whatever and then um i just wanted to call you and say sorry you know i didn't mean to say that and i probably shouldn't have said what i said it should have been more mature about it yeah i mean i i don't really remember you saying anything like that like that i remember that was like you know bad really but no but um i said like i don't know i said something like i did it feel good or something and just i don't know it's really stupid well it's okay i mean i i'm not even really tripping i knew you're joking around like the entire time like he wasn't really like like that's just in your nature you know haters are gonna be like ricegum you didn't even mean the apology to her and you sounded so fake and why were you smiling through the whole thing imagine calling someone and and asking them about something from a year ago that you're like not proud of like connor and be like hey you remember that one time i roasted you about being right you know it's like it was kind of awkward it was really early too so but one last time i am sorry to anyone that was affected by this or anyone that was offended or felt disrespected this joke wasn't funny at all rape is not a joke rape should be taken seriously and i don't know why i thought this was a good idea so i am so sorry and once again haters are gonna hate they're gonna after watching this whole entire video they'll still find a way to hate me but like what more can i do like this was in the past i can't go back in time and you know change it but this is the best i can do i can say sorry to you guys i can say sorry to the girl and i can just learn from this and never do it again which will never happen again because i mean i'm not that stupid come on but okay thank you for hearing me out now you can comment whatever you want to comment racecam you [ __ ] suck whatever um just let me know though do not leave this video without commenting make sure you say something like rice man i lost some respect but i mean at least you're sorry or rice man i watch all your vids but this is an all-time low i'm done watching you i don't know anything you want i just want to know where your head's at you guys kind of know where my head's at i am obviously sorry i said sorry to the girl and you guys i don't know what else i can do once again if there's something else i can do to make this situation better let me know i may be overreacting i may not be but i am really sorry but yeah thank you for making it to the end i've been seeing tweets all day like oh i'm done with this kid unsubscribe but i feel like everyone should see this video you know both side of the story so if you guys can if you see anyone talking that [ __ ] link them this video or you know make sure they know the truth and make sure they know that i'm
