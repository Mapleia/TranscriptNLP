it's been a long time coming for me to share with you some very very important things and I am gonna be reading from what is approved by my legal team so I am once I start getting into what I need to share with you guys today what I feel is important to share with you I won't be deviating and it's at the advice of my legal counsel so there's so much going on on YouTube and in the world and I just first off I do want to request something actually before that I just wanted to tell you that I missed you guys I looked and I'm sorry that you haven't seen me in a while and I'm hoping that this video clears up a lot of the reasons why I felt I could not be online over the past couple of months I have missed making videos and I've missed you so so much but I do want to ask anyone watching this that believes in anything higher than themselves that believes in any higher power you know all higher power all God is love and the root of love and I am a woman of faith and I have been praying every day over this event scandal whatever you want to name it and I just ask that you press pause for a moment and even just for 10 seconds just cover this in prayer because there is so much healing that needs to take place there was a lot of injustice and there's a lot of truth that needs to come forward but it is not going to be easy and it's very painful and I don't wish harm or hate on anyone and I just want to make that very very clear I'm an imperfect person and I do best to be carrying kind and loving and I screw up and I make bad choices and I think that we all right now we go online and it's really easy to make terrible choices even with how you cast a vote on your what your opinion is of someone's you know news story or you know whatever is going on in the world or just anything you see in the media right now be mindful you know we're made to feel like we have to follow the herd and there are so many AI bots and accounts that aren't even real that influence your opinion on whatever narrative is out there and it is just left me feeling really heartbroken if enough people have one opinion about something it feels like the masses turn the tide really quickly and I've witnessed that and I feel like I've experienced that with my own scandal but it's even worse like stepping back from the picture and not being like so close up to it and actually stepping back and with all of the sadness going on in the world you see how quickly the tides turn and I just want to inspire you guys or just empower you actually to look further into yourself and your own opinions and don't follow the herd follow your heart really because I thought I was following mine but I was listening to the wrong people so if you can take anything from this it's listened to your your heart first and always and don't bend on that I feel like sometimes we're afraid to be ourselves in this world like our freedom of speech is expanded in areas and limited in others because the second that someone jumps and disagrees it feels like so many jump with that and you feel voiceless and afraid to speak up and I think that's a scary part of the world right now that some of the good is suppressed and voiceless and I I'm not here for that and I want to speak as much of my truth as I legally and permitted to do and so I'm gonna share what I can and I love you all so much and I'm grateful for anyone that has um come here to hear my experience of 2019 so talking publicly about a wound in my heart that I don't think will ever fully heal is not something I ever wanted to do I avoided it even though I felt the heaviness of so much disappointment until today I made no comment and I have made every effort to move through this with dignity the reality is every day I've struggled quietly trying to rebuild my now poisoned reputation the heartbreak that was born from the scandal still lingers and I feel it won't ever have the opportunity to completely heal until I uncover the truth from all parties involved and their motivation of it all for over a year now every time the scandal is revisited either in the mainstream media or through social platforms I become the number one target of relentless hate while remaining voiceless I've lost over a year of my life terrified of social media and terrified of speaking up against the people that used coerced and manipulated me into uploading my video in May of last year as a result the damage to my health relationships reputation business and general well-being have been enormous the platform that I love this platform that saved my life and that changed my life has become toxic and what it needs now more than ever peacemakers we need to find our way back to the beginning through forgiveness and leading with love we need to rebuild a safe place to escape again our world seems to be falling apart all around us so the last thing you need me to do is feel more hate by releasing my receipts and voice memos but I know many of you are needing some answers as well as a long overdue apology for the role that I played also by the way these are my words I did write this and this is from my heart but I am being careful here and I think you guys understand why back in December 2019 after Shane and Jeffrey's series ended James Charles came to my LA home and we compared dm's texts and stories about what had happened behind the scenes we apologized to each other forgave each other and agreed to wait patiently until it was safe for me to share my story since that night James Charles has repeatedly said that he wanted to be beside me for this video but I felt it was important that I do it alone because he deserves my first apology and I am really sorry James and I've said that privately but I want you to hear it publicly I'm sorry to provide some context it's important for you to know that I love James Charles he has a special place in my heart and that never changed even when I was hurt I promised my dad I wasn't gonna cry um I've been trying to feel it is I've been trying to feel strong enough to do this video cuz I I want to feel strong I don't feel um like I'm able to talk about any of this without getting emotional so forgive my emotions this is really difficult stuff I was always more of a mentor than a friend to James Charles I was someone he could lean on if he needed advice he came into my life after he had sent me a tweet in 2016 and I met him in person for the first time at a generation Beauty event in New York not long after that his cover girl deal was made public and he was off to the races I was a proud friend and I wanted nothing but good things for him a few months later he was a guest at my wedding where he did my makeup for my wedding day it's still my favorite memory of us as it was a gift getting to know him before all of the success James Charles has made his fair share of mistakes and has been in scandals we all have but I always believed in him as he had a rare ability to improve himself through any situation in the past if I was upset it never lasted long he is gifted with turning pain into strength and I've always admired that however prior to the scandal last May I'd started growing frustrated with what I perceived as a progressing sense of entitlement and I felt that he was making some detrimental choices that could jeopardize his career and safety none of my concerns became overwhelming until after I met Shane Dawson when I made my video I expressed my opinions about James Charles's behavior I expressed how much a specific decision he made that I perceived as betrayal hurt me I was very worried and heartbroken but I did not lie in that video I never called James Charles apart and I never said that James Charles was a danger to society my video was not made with any malice I did not publicly air any of the horrific accusations that were being made behind the scenes while I was definitely upset he had accepted a sponsorship from the biggest rival to my brand hallo beauty I did not make my video because of vitamins I made it as a result of all of the poisonous lies that were fed to me by Shane Dawson and Geoffrey star James Charles's sugar bear hair sponsorship and all of the drama that had kicked up afterwards that was just my breaking point yes I'm a grown woman I'm smart I can usually spot deceit and manipulation a mile away but my guard was down from being heartbroken and I allowed myself to be worked by Shane Geoffrey and others after my video went up I was never served a lawsuit or any cease and desist letters I only private in my at the request of YouTube because YouTube said it was a bad look for their platform James I am so sorry that I allowed myself to be poisoned and weaponized against you I'm sorry that I bought into any of their lies believing those lies and allowing myself to be gas-lit into making that video is one of the biggest regrets of my life I should have tried harder to reach you over those concerns in person and I'm sorry for giving up the information they were giving me was terrifying I thought your career and freedom were in jeopardy I was trying to get you to put your phone down and seek help because I was told there were a lot of victims that were going to come forward to destroy you I was foolish for believing them I was scared I thought if I called you out you would put your phone down and stop the detrimental behavior I was being made to believe was true James I apologized for uploading that video I should have known better than to fall for their lies and manipulation but in the end I failed and instead I allowed Shane and Geoffrey to put a wedge between our friendship geoffery star first contacted me early in his YouTube career wanting to meet but it wasn't until 2017 that we started speaking I knew that Jeffrey had had a lot of drama in his past but when he came to me he presented himself as someone who had changed and was trying to be better I saw his pain and I felt that I could be a positive influence as time went on I learned that being friends with Jeffrey star was like being friends with a lion yes he may have been dangerous but he was always really kind to me from time to time I would see improvements which were followed by setbacks thereafter but overall I thought he was growing as a person and again I thought I could be a good example for him I even tried to get him involved with my favorite charity diverting from script PS I am gonna be speaking on my real life more freely I hope in the future and the things that I think are important I have participated in this charity for years on end know and I love their work and I really I had it in my head that if I could pull Jeffrey somehow into like being a role model or feeling resealing like a role model that that could be really empowering to him and when you empower someone to feel good about feeling good it will help them change and if you just tear someone down no change so I did try to get him involved with my favorite charities spirit awakening Foundation which helps at-risk kids that had found themselves in legal trouble but are trying to change their lives for the better my intentions with Jeffrey were good but I was a fool for thinking that I could ever help him become a better person which brings me back to another long overdue apology Jackie I know Jackie the moment that Geoffrey went off the moment that Geoffrey went off on you the day before my first video collab with him went live I should have run for the hills I was naive I was excited about the video I got it twisted that you had provoked Geoffrey because you were angry that I had phoned with someone who had a history of being labeled by others as a racist Jackie I'm sorry that I did not do the right thing and walk away from him then I should have not been blind to the reasons behind the accusations of his racism I shouldn't have defended him and I regret any of the pain that I may have caused you and for the record loud and clear I've always liked you and I've always enjoyed you every interaction that we've had face to face and I let you down and I am so genuinely sorry for that in 2018 I saw from the sidelines what happened in drama getting wine with Manny Laura Gabriel Nikita that should have been to me some big red flag of what happens when Jeffrey is unhappy with someone but for some twisted sense of civic duty I thought it was my responsibility to stay in Jeffrey's life and try to help him become a better person when Shane Dawson's first series with Jeffrey happened from all outside appearances it looked like Jeffrey was actually changing for the better he was accepting responsibility for things that had happened in his past and he was pledging to be a better person I believed him again during those first two years of knowing Jeffrey it's important to note that we did not actually spend much time together I was invited a few times to go to his home but I usually declined on the two occasions that I did go to his home I did not stay long because I don't smoke marijuana and I just don't like to be around it likewise he came to my home on a few occasions and he also did not stay long so the vast majority of our relationship was primarily by FaceTime telephone or texts sometimes weeks or months would go by without hearing anything from him but I always heard from him when he was involved in drama or when he had a new launch about to happen though I recognized this pattern any suspicion that I had of being used was clouded by the hope that he actually cared for me and that I was a positive influence in his life as a result I usually would take his snarky statements about others with a grain of salt one thing that he did that did concern me a lot was how he would frequently comment about how much dirt he held on other brand owners members of our YouTube community I believe that he actually held blackmail material on many people and was capable of destroying the entire community this worried me about him and I stayed and I tried my best to be a positive influence my opinion he's gonna go off guys and I don't think anyone III don't think he will hold back and I think we need to be prepared to understand that we need to forgive the people that he is holding hostage with veiled threats of exposure we need to be prepared to forgive them otherwise this won't stop so prepare to not cancel everyone can give him a chance it's not right it is not right to try to trap people into saying things that they wouldn't otherwise say it's not right I was blind I was so blind and I don't want any part of it anymore none none back in 2019 Jeffrey started talking a lot more crap about James Charles unusual it seemed that doing so had become his biggest obsession it started with him telling me right before filming our collab together for James Charles's channel that James Charles actually didn't want me there that he had wanted nikkietutorials instead but said he had had my back things further escalated at my birthday every time James Charles his back was turned Jeffrey would tell me that James Charles was out of control he even text didn't called me the following morning to apologize for James Charles's behavior at my birthday dinner and how embarrassed he was for me I initially dismissed it as jealousy because James Charles's career was on a rocket ship at the time but as the week's went by every time I saw her spoke with Jeffrey it seemed to me that James was all he wanted to talk about I even met with Jeffrey in his killer merch offices in March to discuss Jeffrey developing and managing my merch and as we were touring his warehouse that was filled with sisters apparel it seemed that all he could do was speak poorly of James Charles over the next few weeks Jeffrey began talking to me about how Shane Dawson was a big fan of mine and wanted to meet me and how I should be involved in their docu-series eventually Shane reached out to me by text and started deeming me on Instagram Shane said I was the queen of makeup reviews on YouTube that I was his favorite beauty Channel and he wanted me to teach him all about makeup I didn't know much about Shane Dawson I knew that he was viewed as the king of YouTube and he had done amazing series with funny and I hadn't watched much of anything else other than Jake Paul series and of course the series with Jeffrey in all honesty I was looking forward to meeting Shane I had actually hoped he would want to help me tell my personal story one day about all the pain and heartbreak in my life that led me to wanting to start my own YouTube channel back in 2010 I wish I had researched him better I wish I had watched his old videos I wish I had educated myself and I was aware of his earlier content all I knew at the time was that Shane Dawson was the most adored documentary filmmaker on YouTube so I invited him over to my home to play with makeup and to get to know him Shane came over one afternoon in April and I opened up and shared things that I've only shared with my closest of friends I shared that I had been the victim of sexual assault I spoke about my faith and told him how deeply I feel for others he shared with me that he was an empath and that he could feel all of my pain he pledged his unending Frenship and loyal to me forever in this life and the next one he told me that God had called me to be a beacon of light for the world so that it could be a better place he also shared that Jeffrey had wanted me to have a small role in their docu-series but the entire series was quickly changing because there was something horrible happening in our community with James Charles he said that James Charles was a monster with many victims yes I knew that Shane was friends with Jeffrey and that they were working together but I thought to myself why would Shane Dawson the king of truth on YouTube be turning against James Charles unless these things he was saying were true why would Shane sit in my home and spend so many hours telling me these horrific allegations if they were not true Shane said that James Charles was a monster and that James Charles was hurting miners Shane said he was planning to interview victims for the docu-series he told me that something needed to be done to stop him from hurting more people over the course of the next few weeks he and Jeffrey fed me so much information that I felt sick almost every day there was more information and new allegations eventually I started believing what they were saying because they said they had evidence by the time the drama around James Charles his promotion of sugarbear hair reached its peak I was beyond gas-lit Shane Dawson didn't just know about my by sister video he offered to help edit it he even offered to design the thumbnail and help title it I declined his offer but his gesture supported and reinforced for me that he was telling the truth why else would he jeopardize his career so surely Jeffrey was telling the truth to keep in mind that up and to this point I didn't even know I was making a video so how is it that so many editorial outlets knew that something was coming before I had even made a decision to film I struggled with the decision to film my video for days the night before I did film Jeffrey sent me what he lamed was an audio file from an alleged victim and told me to listen to the pain in their voice the audio was clearly a small portion of a larger conversation it wasn't enough for me to contact the authorities it was enough to scare me as a victim of abuse myself I know how terrifying it is to think of facing public humiliation and legal proceedings it wasn't my place to contact authorities it was not my place to contact authorities or the alleged victim and I made no mention of it in my video the night before posting my video by sister I texted Shane sharing my concerns for James Charles that he was out of the country on the high floor of a hotel and I was afraid for him hurting himself Shane texted me back and said that I should not be nervous about the 50th floor that James Charles was a narcissist and that he would never do that the day the video went up Shane requested to come over to my home and film and document what was happening I declined after a few days of Jeffrey Fanning the flames on Twitter no victims appeared as they had stated would happen and no evidence came forward as they stayed it would happen the last time I spoke with either Jeffrey or Shane on the phone was the night before Jeffrey's never doing this again video shortly after the relationship dissolved entirely and I was so confused I bought into the conspiracy theory that what happened was all a social experiment and that maybe James Charles was even involved and that there was going to be a big reveal in Shane's docu-series and I would be a fool who fell for it Shane never reached out to check on me and he never shared the trailer with me well last time we spoke on the phone was before Geoffrey's apology video and I asked him to not include the drama in the series he only texted me after the trailer was live with an audio message telling me to not worry about it that drama was only gonna be one episode for the next few months I was tormented with sub tweets and innuendo that there was a huge drama around the corner I felt that I was a liability to them and that I knew too much so I put all of my text messages and other files on a hard drive and told a few people that I was afraid for my life and had given everything to my lawyers I was hoping that information would leak as I thought it might keep me safe my mental and physical health suffered my business has suffered it was all I could do to pull myself together for the launch of tachi mutti that night helped me so much to everyone that came because I felt like I didn't have community anymore and I was too ashamed to even think about inviting anyone for my sanity and I'm just so grateful and I just hope that you're still there oh yeah heart attack Oh last fall I became so afraid to stay in my LA home that I both filmed a lot of videos and I left town in October to get away from it all I was so upset that I continued to lose weight I couldn't sleep and slowly became a shell of my former self I had intended on pursuing fertility treatments in 2019 but my mind and body were just too frail my mind and body were just too frail to support a pregnancy wasn't until this series ended in December when James Charles and I met that I started to realize what it actually happened over the next few months a few people have bravely come forward with more information and the pieces of what we believe actually happened are coming together make no mistake this is far from over I've been terrified for a very long time so much so that I had to relocate again two months ago and I have taken serious security precautions to ensure my safety on the advice of my attorneys I cannot share with all of you right now the evidence that we have accumulated of the events that have occurred however there will soon come a day where we will be able to present this evidence and you will be able to see why it is we believe that Jeffrey and Shane are responsible for so much of the damage that has been caused I can tell you this it's now my opinion that Jeffrey and Shane were both bitterly jealous of James Charles's success Jeffery resented that so much of his business was centered around his biggest rival and Shane did not like that James Charles wanted to make a documentary neither of them were happy with standing in his shadow on YouTube anymore I believe James Charles was gaining more followers and receiving more views and more press faster than anyone in the history on the platform and it's also my opinion that Jeffrey and Shane needed James marginalized and out of the way for their November launch of the conspiracy palette along with Shane's merch I've also recently been informed that Jeffrey is allegedly a co-owner of morphe before the scandal occurred I had also been told that James Charles was about to develop an entire cosmetics line with the owners of Murphy entire situation opens up a Pandora's box of speculation but I'm just not sure anyone counted on this drama spreading like wildfire it's my opinion that everyone involved got scared and their plan changed multiple times as I refused to play along or engage with the drama over the next several months a year later it is now my opinion that James Charles was not their only intended target I believe that there are many different people who have unclean hands in all of this and there was a coordinated plan to keep me quiet and pushed me out of the way for other business reasons I do not think it's a coincidence that morphe is about to launch their own brand of hair skin nail gummy vitamins I do not think it was just Shane and Jeffrey that stood to benefit from my being silenced this was just too big I think there were many players and I have every intention of getting to the truth in early May when Jeffrey went on a podcast and denied responsibility for his involvement and placed blame on me it was both cowardly in defamatory last week when Shane issued his statements about his involvement in all of this I also perceived them as cowardly and defamatory as for everyone else involved that did anything underhanded or defamatory over the last year I am still well within the statute of limitations for bringing a civil action to seek recovery for my damages should I proceed with this course of actions my attorneys will be deposing all witnesses who have information about the truth of what happened here so for everyone else whose hands are dirty that have not yet come forward be careful of your allegiance you don't want to be on the wrong side of the truth I'm sorry I was unable to provide you with receipts that I'm sure you want I've told you everything that I can right now the remainder will be handled privately or at a time that I choose to speak publicly on it again to the incredible people who watch my videos because they love makeup as much as I do I'm so sorry that this situation cost so much pain and frustration and I truly miss you all and I'm working really hard to heal myself to become strong again so that I can come back to this platform that I hold so dear doing a really terrible job not crying and I'm sorry I just want to get my life back and I don't want to feel like this for what in the description below this video you're gonna find a link where you can learn more about the spirit awakening foundation that was founded by one of my biggest heroes and spiritual advisors ikuyo Graham wick public thank you to you because this woman helped me so much she has this grace and love where even just one conversation just just really challenges you to look

good than bad and I'm really really grateful for that and I really promise to not cry - during this video and I just could not do it it's been a lot of pain I am turning to God to get me through it
