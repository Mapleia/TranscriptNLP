hi everyone i hope you're doing well this video is to address recent comments and criticisms that i've received i know this video is long overdue and i planned a vacation for around this time but i honestly should not have taken any time off prior to acknowledging or addressing or apologizing for these things not only that but i should have properly apologized when the incidents actually occurred it shouldn't have taken me this long to come to a proper understanding of how to handle these situations and how to apologize for that but i hope that i can do that today so i have a list of topics i want to address and i'll go through them one by one there are certain things that i want to give my perspective on and also some things that i need to apologize for so i hope that you can watch the video in its entirety and form your own opinions firstly there was an incident back at the end of 2018 where mean keemstar had an argument over twitter and a youtuber by the name of beaublox took screenshots of these tweets and then uploaded them kind of as an archive on youtube and at the time my mcn told me that because they are screenshots of my tweets that i can have the video taken down and keemstar had deleted his tweets i didn't want the drama to snowball into something more and i honestly regretted even starting an argument in the first place so i agreed and the video was taken down this was my mistake because at the time i didn't consider the fairness of leaving that video up as well as not properly understanding the fair use defense when it comes to transformative content so when this happened beau blacks was understandably upset once i saw his tweets and comments regarding the situation and how he felt i messaged him privately and we tried to resolve things indians later on in january of 2019 other people had heard of the situation without knowing that i had approached beaublox privately and that we had spoken about it so it became a much larger more public issue pokeman she striked this video called keemstar vs pokemon twitter fine someone decided to put these two videos in together and upload it on youtube so basically this twitter drama became an even bigger drama thanks to the youtube algorithm so in a way i can understand why you want to take down this video but the problem here is that you're just drawing more attention to it and frankly my apology at the time was not very good or was not good enough period so i just want to reiterate that i'm sorry for taking down that video and since then i have not taken down any videos like that and i've genuinely tried to learn from my mistake alongside this there's another incident that i frequently see people use clips of where i'm talking to someone about having their video removed anyways i'll be taking down some of your videos but yeah i just hope you stop doing this and i would just like to add in some additional context prior to discussing this situation pokemane pregnant [Music] dude the section hokeymane twerk live on stream so why do you do this when you make these videos and you like talk about my butt or me being pregnant or whatever and you know it's like all fake or you know that you're trying to use like oh it's just a clickbait in the [ __ ] title yeah how does it like why do you falsely click bait yo this was easy as clickbait bro do i sound mean yes that's why i'm trying to talk to you so as you can see this person was re-uploading my content or my stream but then adding really inappropriate sexual gross or just misleading titles and i had some of these sorts of videos taken down back then but only because they were my content or my stream re-uploaded unfortunately this has led to people assuming that i take down videos of people criticizing me behind the scenes she actively tries to censor the internet and by the internet i mean anything negative about her people made videos about her and she's copyright strike them the list goes on and on if you make a video that is negative about her she's gonna try to gun you copyright claiming on youtube is used as censorship and for pokeman this seems to be the case a lot of the time this is something that i've never done if someone puts in the time and effort it takes to create a video where they're talking about me regardless of how positive or negative it is or if they use clips of me that is very clearly transformative content and i would never take down content like that the other incidents were a bit more complicated because it was situations where people were re-uploading content of mine or something that i put out there regardless i still handled those situations badly and i regret the way that i handled them and i'm sorry for the way that i handled them but i just want to make it really clear that i fully support transformative content it's an amazing creative outlet and allows people to make a living off the internet in the same way that i've been so lucky to do my understanding of what should or shouldn't be taken down on youtube two years ago was not well informed and i've tried really really hard to learn from my mistakes and not make the same mistakes and since then i stopped allowing my mcn to take down videos on my behalf and the only exception nowadays is when let's say for example i do a cooking stream and i want to re-upload that cooking stream on my youtube because my stream is public and my vaults are public people can also take that same content and re-upload it at the same time and with the youtube algorithm usually this means that one video is pushed and the other is kind of suppressed because they're the same piece of content um and one person like an audience will usually not watch both because they're the same thing so only under those very specific and pretty rare circumstances am i kind of forced to take down the duplicate content of mine but again this does not all apply to if someone's talking about me or criticizing me that is entirely their content i would never touch it sorry this is a bit of a nuanced topic but i hope i properly explained myself and added some transparency to the situation and if i have to clarify anything in the future then i'll make sure to do that secondly there was a recent incident where i was on stream and i watched a video made by it's a gundam and i made some remarks that i shouldn't have and that i'm very sorry for and i'd like to provide context and then apologize for what i said so the part of the video that i watched was him talking down on my fans and he was showing some tweets that were very clearly jokes but talking about them as if they're facts i hope people know that tweets like this are a joke in hindsight i can totally understand how if someone was unsure if it's legitimacy it could be pretty upsetting to see something like this i also want to remind people that i or any streamer does not want you to donate if you can't afford it everyone should always take care of themselves and their families first and i try really hard to regularly say the same thing when i'm streaming as well back to the video while he had this joke tweet pulled up he also had a very real photo of a fan with me at a meet and greet and he was making fun of them and the way that they look here we have this gentleman right here this guy is totally alpha so this guy who looks like a pixar animated character oh god i love this guy's face he's like a gnome dude he doesn't even have wrists good lore he can't wear a watch and i've been mocked countless times for my appearance but i understand that's part of putting myself out there on the internet it just felt so unfair to see that happen to an innocent fan who didn't write this tweet had nothing to do with the situation and so in my opinion just didn't deserve it and i got really caught up in that feeling and i was so bothered and also bothered by people's potential perceptions when seeing this video and i must admit i reacted really poorly this led me to making some comments questioning why the video was sponsored but regardless of my opinion on the content that's not okay and i'll do better when sharing my concerns without having to comment on any part of the video that isn't the actual content of the video i want to sincerely apologize to both it's a gundam and to the sponsor of that video for the remarks and comments that i made i completely understand people's concern for going after someone else's livelihood especially in a time like this and i wouldn't want to see that sort of thing happen to someone else i also don't want to see that sort of thing become a larger tactic or trend on youtube so again i'm very very sorry and i'll make sure that in the future if i am to comment on any part of a video it's just it's actual contents not the sponsors and also not to encourage my community or my viewers to leave any sort of negative feedback i sometimes see a clip and a tweet circulating from the past where i've said the n-word i believe the tweet is from about five years ago and the clip from about seven years ago and although i never said it with ill intent or racial context or the hard r i still want to make it clear that i don't condone the use of that language and i don't want my deletion of these things or my silence now to make it seem otherwise i've commented on this in the past but honestly my statement or comments then weren't even good enough even though people were very understanding i just want to make it clear that i am genuinely so sorry if i hurt or offended anyone with what i said i really wish i could go back in time and change the past unfortunately i can't but i do hope that my behavior in regards to language for the last couple of years and onwards will speak for itself there are some final points i'd like to quickly touch on although they're not as important as the aforementioned things they are just topics that have been frequently brought up and kind of intertwined with more important criticisms i've seen a lot of people talk about the way that i look recently just want to put it out there i don't think i'm the prettiest person in the world but i think that's okay everyone's entitled to an opinion as an online personality or content creator there's quite a lot of pressure to look perfect all the time and i feel like it's created a bit of um a culture that is really detrimental to the self-esteem of honestly just about anyone that has social media so i don't at all regret the no makeup streams or photos i've posted in the past i want to make it really clear to anyone out there that it's okay not to look instagram ready all the time and that you can be perfectly all right with both the version of you that's more glammed up and the way that you look on a bad day both versions of you are perfectly okay i personally made the decision seven years ago or whenever i got into streaming that i don't want my personal life to be a part of my content in general relationship stuff is stuff that i don't like to talk about outright because even when i'm single like imagine how many people care and then if i got into a relationship even more people would be invested in what is going on in my relationship and if i had a relationship i would want it to just be like between me and that person and not a million people giving their unwanted opinion and advice and the thought of that just makes my brain boom and that's just what i'm gonna stick by until i and whoever i'm dating at whatever time decide otherwise for me this also creates a healthier divide between my work life and my personal life which is an area where the lines are already pretty blurred i understand some people want to relate this to donations but you could also argue that one can make a lot of money by publicizing the relationship or making content out of it and neither of these things are wrong at all i'm happy for others whatever lifestyle they choose i just personally feel like everyone has a right to privacy i personally want to be able to experience my relationships without the scrutiny of an online audience and if you disagree that's totally all right you don't have to support me or my content content is very popular both on twitch and on youtube whether it's good content bad content transformative or lazy is understandably up for debate i can't say with certainty one way or the other all i can say is that i do my best to engage with whatever content is on my stream and honestly oftentimes to the point of annoying my viewers anyways back to the video oh yeah what i was gonna say and it's not the first time that people have said mom i saw oh my god that reminds me of captain bucky have a brutal fight but steve is able he thinks his friend dies we are tracer games so he again free pass again some days it's just nice to have a chill relaxing stream with your chat oftentimes i'm recording with offline tv or other collabs or other influencers and so being able to do that is a nice balance in content for a nice break per se after the copyright controversy i've been especially cautious of this the only content i ever leave up on my stream if i'm not actively present and engaging with it is either my videos or offline tv videos to end things off again i'm really sorry that this video is late despite my planned break i should have addressed these things sooner or i should have addressed these things as the incidents individually occurred or better yet the incidents shouldn't have occurred in the first place i need to be better in facing things head on and just doing better in general there was a lot of guilt during my time off and it helped me better reflect on things i have of course a responsibility to myself to take care of my mental health but i also have a responsibility to all of you to improve and to just be a better example so overall i really do feel like i let some things get to me that i shouldn't have and i hope that moving forwards i can just be appreciative of the amazing community i have and the platforms that i have and i also want to add that i know criticism is bound to come in many different ways i just really want to thank anybody that discussed any of these topics in a constructive manner reading your comments or thoughts genuinely helped me better understand my wrongdoings as well as just further my perspective so thank you thank you for listening i hope i can do and be better for you all have a good day bye you
