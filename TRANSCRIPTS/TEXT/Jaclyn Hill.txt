hey guys welcome back to my channel for today's video I don't even need to give you an intro you know why we are here I want to address some of the issues that my customers are having with my first launch of my brand jackin cosmetics and my lipsticks first and foremost I would let you guys know the basis I'm going to be covering throughout this video I want to talk about the melting issue I want to talk about the white fuzzies I want to talk about the black holes and I want to talk about the grittiness and the texture that you guys are experiencing and give you informed details of what all of these issues are what is causing them and how they are going to be fixed I just want to put that out there before we've been jumping in to the actual video so that you guys know that I'm not gonna run away from this and I know it's taken me a couple days to get all my ducks in a row and get this video out for you guys but I've been going through all the documentation and on the phone with labs and chemists and the owner of my lab and my entire team for several days and doing a very in-depth investigation to figure out exactly what's going on so I can give you the most informed information as a brand owner the first thing that I want to address before anything else is the accusations that my lipsticks are expired moldy or hazardous in any way shape or form I'm gonna put up documents throughout this entire video so you guys can see the actual proof because I'm not gonna sit here and like read papers to you guys I'm gonna put it right through the screen so you can see proof so number one let's start with the expired accusation my lipsticks did not go into mass production until the same month that I actually launched my brand it was only a couple weeks before a couple weeks prior to my launch that we started actual mass production although I had been so in depth with my formulation my colors and approving all of that mass production did not go in to production until right before my Lodge because we wanted them to be fresh we don't the mists own shelves and because my brand has been pushed back so many times I actually already went through the same situation with a different lab several years ago I went into mass production ended up having an issue while in mass production and then didn't launch my brand and had to go to a whole new lab because I didn't want those issues to happen again so I cancelled them and went somewhere else I try to cover my tracks I've dug but they are not expired I know you guys have seen photos of my components all over my socials here and there throughout the last couple of years I've been working on my components for 5 years straight to get it perfect but just because I've been working on a component you guys have seen that does not mean there's an actual lipstick inside of it that I kept on a shelf and sold to you guys just want to put that out there and know my intentions and what's real what's not and give you the facts second of all my lipsticks are not moldy they are not hazardous they are not contaminated they're not unsafe for you in any way shape or form every single ingredient in my lipstick is new and it is FDA approved and again I will give you proof right here if you guys want to look over these documents in-depth and tear them apart you go right ahead and see that they are not contaminated every single ingredient is FDA approved and they are not expired I want to ease your minds with that before even getting into all the nitty-gritty stuff of this video so that you're not sitting here thinking like oh my gosh is it true that if I use this lipstick that it's gonna it's gonna hurt me in some way no that is not the case and now you guys have seen that so let's move forward all right so the first thing I want to touch base on are the little black dots or black holes that you guys are seeing what these black dots are are actually oxygen bubbles and they are being lifted to the service when my lipstick bullet is being cooled off when it's going from a hot temperature fresh out of the VAT and it's gonna go into my actual component and just be cooled down so that the component cap can be put on top in that process sometimes those oxygen bubbles don't make it all the way through and you'll see little itty bitty almost like black like holes it's not actually like black holes again it's not mold it is oxygen and it is 100% safe it is not gonna hurt you but seeing those dots are not pretty and they're not like you don't look at that component you don't look at that lipstick and things like oh yeah I want to put this on my lips so if you're experiencing that please contact help at Jacqueline cosmetics comm show us a photo of your product we will send you not only a full refund but we will also give you a brand new lipstick that does not have any of those issues that you're concerned about the second thing I want to touch on is the texture and the grittiness that you guys are seeing in your lipsticks now although this is not happening to everybody it's still happening and basically what this is caused from is the humongous vats it's almost like I always want to use the word beaker but it's not like a beaker or smaller it's like these gigantic huge vats there in labs like this gigantic thing that holds all of your lipstick and it like spins like this and mixes everything up that VAT is not breaking down all my raw materials because we produce so many lipsticks so quickly again all the products in these vats are 100% FDA approved ingredients and totally good and safe for you to use but they're not being broken down small enough and smoothly enough which I take full responsibility for we made a lot of product in a very short amount of time and although we all thought that it was gonna be perfect and fresh that's not the case we move too quickly and because of that the ingredients are not broken down I will say this you're still gonna get the same effect on your lips they're still gonna give you a nice creamy formulation it's still gonna look beautiful once it's applied but it's not pretty to look at and when you apply it sometimes you can feel like a little bit of that texture that greediness and that is so not okay and I want to make that right for you and again I'm gonna reiterate it over and over and over to contact help at Jacqueline cosmetics comm of course I will put that email in the video I'll put it down below contact them all you need to do is show them any proof a video a photo whatever is and we will take care of everything for you and make it right I know a lot of people are like yeah what if people are lying I don't even care like I want to make this right for my customers this is my first launch and it's very embarrassing I'm not gonna make it about myself in any way and tell you how I feel about this but it's embarrassing for me to not see you guys fully happy and I am so so sorry that any of you are experiencing anything less than absolute perfection from my first launch and I will do whatever it takes to make it up for you I will send you a brand new lipstick I will pay for it myself I'll give you a full refund I don't care I want you guys to experience the products that I approved the I love and what I want to create for my brand going forward next let's talk about the white fuzzies this is the thing that gets me going so when I first heard the definition and the reason for these white fuzzies on some of these lipsticks i 100% did not believe it I got very upset and I was like why are you lying to me why you trying to treat me like I'm an idiot this is ridiculous like I need a better explanation but after thorough investigation we know what the actual issue is and I know that a lot of you guys don't have a hard time believing this because I did as well this is the truth because my lipstick component is a silver shiny almost metal like material MyLab instead of using a standard glob that they would use in the lab they decided to use white cotton gloves they're like fluffy white gloves because they didn't want the standard gloves to put any smears on this component to in any way have any sort of prints on it so they want to do a white fluffy glove first when I heard this I thought but wait how are a couple people wearing white fluffy gob gloves gonna put this many fluffy white little fuzzies all over my products that doesn't make sense right well then once I started seeing videos I started seeing proof and then my team actually did our own investigation it actually made a lot more sense in my mind and I'll tell you guys exactly what that is we have several people up to 20 people working on my lipsticks on the line every single day as they're being produced and every single of those people are wearing white gloves when I tell you guys how many times a day they have to change gloves and put on new ones it's crazy every time I need to take a call they have to step off the floor off the line out of the production area they just take off their gloves and they have to get brand new ones when they walk back in they have to take off their hair nuts they take off their beer nuts they'd replace everything once they come back in they don't get to walk out go to the bathroom put on the same gloves and come back in so when you think about 15 20 people working on a line all replacing their gloves every 30 minutes 45 minutes hour hour and a half it's a lot of brand new freshly white gloves coming in to that region that is spreading lint all over the product not acceptable at all and the second we saw this we changed to different gloves that will not be giving this issue whatsoever on top of that they were cleaning my vats which is the big humungous bucket that has my batches inside of it they were cleaning those and vats with like this white fiber almost towel going through it and that's been happening about once a day they said two sometimes twice a day depending how quickly we're moving through batches so those two things combined that is what you were experiencing our little white cotton fibers coming off of their gloves and it is so beyond unacceptable and I'm so sorry this happened to you guys and for obvious reasons we will no longer be making any more products with this lab because that's just not what you guys deserve so again contact me and my team we will get you a full refund and a new perfect bullet that does not look like that but let me just say this it is not harmful for you this is not in any way harmful it's just little white cotton fuzzies that come from a very sterile environment still not okay but as much you guys know that if it doesn't bother you it doesn't bother you like I've had several people contact me they're like oh I don't care it's white and often use it and I'm like that's fine but still it's not perfect and it's not what I want for my product so contact Jacqueline Cosmetics and we will figure it out and we'll make it right last thing I want to talk about the melting issue and even though you guys are seeing a lot of stuff all of our social media like when I log on to social media I'm just like oh my god but from the backend of my brand and actually looking at emails the biggest issue and the biggest complaint is actually the melting issue it's actually 80% of our complaints is melting and I know it's crazy right you would think that like the grittiness and all that other stuff but no all the other stuff is only 20% which is insane because social media is so loud and out there and it looks like it's so aggressive and so terrible but behind the scenes of what I'm seeing I'm like alright please contact me if you're having an issue reach out like I want to fix it for you you know like I want to prove myself to you and I thought that I was gonna do that when I first launched but I and I made mistakes and for that I am so sorry but please allow me to help make this right for you anyways about the Melting situation which is about 80% of complaints like I said people are receiving some lipsticks in the mail and then they pull them out they twist them up they swatch them they break they break in the center is you twist them up all the way they'll break at the face which is pretty standard even if you don't have a melted lipstick if you roll all the way up and you swatch it chances are if it's an emollient base lipstick it's going to break at the base so make sure that when you use your lip sticks you do not roll up fully all the way when you are using it just a side note but what people are experiencing is it's showing up in the mail and it's almost having like a little sweat mark like a little like circular sweat mark or like little like sweat dots and then when you swatch it the lips it kind of leans to the side and then it's got like a little little line on it because it's a very creamy very emollient based product so you really have to make sure that it's fully cooled down before using it we did an extensive tests on my lipsticks and shipping from here to there and all this jazz but because of the climate right now we are shipping to some people who are in such hot temperatures and such high degree that my lipsticks they're not surviving it fully my testing actually came out to about 140 degrees Fahrenheit which means that my specific lipstick can withstand 140 degrees before actually melting all the way through which is a very high temperature but once these lipsticks are getting onto trucks that are you know a hundred degrees on the inside these UPS trucks and then they're sitting outside of people's houses up their front doors while they're at work and then they come home and they pull it out yes they're not fully melted all the way through and just like a puddle inside but yeah they might have a little sweat dots on them when you swatch them they might kind of lean to the side so please give your lipsticks enough time to fully cool off before you go in and apply it we are working on a solution for that for you guys right now though so that again you're not dealing with anything that's gonna dis satisfy you like I just want to make sure that you guys are happy that's all it matters to me and if there's anything I'm not covering in this video that I haven't seen on social media please again contact my team and I and we will take care of you now that I have been like spazzing going through all of this because I'm just so eager to get this video up I really just want to take a moment to genuinely thank those of you who have reached out to me telling me what's going on and everyone on Twitter and Instagram who are genuinely sending me photos like asking me and concerned I am very grateful for your honesty I'm very grateful for you coming forward and telling me what's going on because I want to fix this and I would never know if you guys didn't keep me informed so I want to say thank you very much to everybody who has come forth because I did an interview about my brand a couple months ago and that's what I said in this interview I said that my number one thing is I want my subscribers to be honest with me I want them to tell me genuinely what they feel about my product so that I can I can continue to take your information and move forward with it and give you the best products that you guys could receive like that's very important to me and I'm very sorry that this launch was not absolutely 100 percent perfect with a bow on it but we will make it right for you and going forward we will no longer be experiencing these experiences that we are having and we are taking drastic measures to change that and make sure that everything is amazing for you I actually have had to pull several launches because I was doing them with this lab that I had coming up and had to change labs on several different products so there's gonna be a slight delay and some things later on but that doesn't matter like I just want to make sure that you guys are receiving the best of the absolute best so in the future even if you choose not to be a Jacqueline Cosmetics customer even if you lose trust in me that's okay like I understand I promise you guys all around the board perfect products and not all of them were all around the board a perfect product so I get it but I'm going to work very hard and I'm gonna work very diligently to make sure that within the next couple of months within the next year you're gonna look at my brand and be like oh wow this actually is good like she actually corrupted her air and she learned from her mistakes because it's exactly what I'm going to do and I'm so sorry for anyone who received anything less than perfect I
