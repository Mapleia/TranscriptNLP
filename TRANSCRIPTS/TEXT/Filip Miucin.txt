hey everyone I understand that there are people who want to know the reasoning behind what I did and I might not have made that very clear in my last video so hopefully this video will help shed some light on any unanswered questions when I started my youtube channel I started it because it was something that I really loved doing I love making videos and I love playing video games but when I started my channel I didn't anticipate everything happening as fast as it did I didn't expect to grow as fast as I did I really bit off more than I can chew I felt pretty confident with my video editing skills and my abilities to create visually appealing content but I wasn't always confident with my abilities as a writer so I took from sources who I trusted and respected and and I agreed with and I tried to change them in a way that I would say it but obviously looking back I can see that I still had a lot of growing up to do and I had a lot to learn and when I got that big break with this awesome gaming company my insecurities were amplified by like 10 million because the audience was bigger and the expectations were higher I really wanted to do well but I was also really scared of saying the wrong thing or putting out a bad review I am a video editor first and foremost and I love video games and making videos about video games but I should have been able to own up to myself that I just wasn't the right person for that job and you know I'm sure everyone else would agree some might people might be wondering why I even took that job in the first place but the truth is it really was my dream job just like I'm sure it was for a lot of people I was blinded by my excitement to work alongside so many of the people that I've been following for so long and I guess I just underestimated what it takes to be an IGN editor producer and podcast host and I know that I should have done this a lot sooner but I was given advice not to by people who I trust to not come forward and talk about plagiarism in the media but I regret it because that's not the person I am that's not the type of person I am I can and do own up to my own mistakes and this this was the biggest mistake of my life so I hope that helps answer at least some questions but if not please feel free to leave a comment down below and I'll do my best to answer as many of your questions as I can I know that I disappointed this community and I owe you guys I owe it to you to be as open as possible so thank you very much and I'll see you soon [Music]
