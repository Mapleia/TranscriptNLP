what is up no intro I can't do the intro that just feels stupid do the [ __ ] intro earlier today I was so proud of drama Lert I was so proud people were giving me [ __ ] on Twitter and I was just I'm so proud of how successful my show has been becoming but now as I sit here in front of you I don't feel proud at all I feel ashamed I feel like a like a [ __ ] dirtbag like an [ __ ] like a [ __ ] I feel horrible horrible is the best word for it I feel horrible I take pride in this show I I work hard on this show I have people that work with me on this show and earlier today someone on my news team provided me with a story that I thought was vetted that I thought was correct and it wasn't it was wrong and this isn't a little [ __ ] up this is a big [ __ ] up this is a serious big [ __ ] up to the point where I just feel ashamed I feel ashamed I can't believe that we would [ __ ] up like this we reported a story that this Massachusetts man John Phillips had sex with a teen that he married an online game in runescape back in 2011 okay and then he got out of jail and that he's streaming on twitch again now the problem with this is that that's not John that's a gentleman named Tony and when we reported this video a bunch of you went over and harassed this guy called him names pedo sex offender you name it this guy didn't [ __ ] do anything he didn't do anything wrong and because of me he was harassed for about two hours I was streaming at the time on my own livestream and someone came in and said you know you got it wrong you got the story wrong and I thought they were [ __ ] with me I thought they were [ __ ] with me I didn't at first I like blew it off and then after about 10 minutes I went into the Skype chat when my news team went through questioned the guy that get me the news and asked him how did you vet this how did you confirm any of this and he said him and another person on my news team sat there for hours looking at the faces and identified who was who and that it was the right guy and I just I [ __ ] lost it my heart sunk into my stomach the minute he gave me this explanation that they matched the faces I realized that we just so [ __ ] up and I just I [ __ ] died right there on my live stream like I immediately took down the video and I immediately uploaded a video to Twitter telling everyone that we got this story wrong and that we've taken the video and that the guy that works for me is no longer working for me and any damages that we've caused this guy Tony that we are going to take care of I feel horrible I mean I know the responsible thing to do was to do what we did right I know the responsible thing is to acknowledge that we got this wrong take down the [ __ ] video and try to take care of the guy and fix this financially or any way that he wants to make sure that we somehow fix our wrongdoings and I feel like we've done that because prior to any video being made about the situation prior to anyone talking about this situation we came out first and acknowledged that we were wrong I think you know we came out six hours ago as I'm making this and the videos that were made about me and how we [ __ ] this up are like three hours so we came out a full three hours before anyone made a video talking about this saying that we got it wrong that we're going to responsibilities that we've taken down the video that we removed that guy off and I'm not telling you this to somehow defend me or make me look better in any way but I just want to point out that if you think that we don't take this serious you're wrong we take this very serious I I feel [ __ ] horrible I pride myself on getting you the facts like I pride myself on getting this right and not only did I fail you but I failed this stranger that I don't even know that sent a bunch of hate his way like it just this innocent guy that had nothing to do with anything and I just I want to fix it I want to apologize I want to talk to this guy Tony and see if there's anything I can do I want to I don't ever want to [ __ ] up like this again I don't ever want to fail you like this again I'm sorry I'm sorry we got this wrong I pride myself on being right and I was not right this time and Tony if you're watching we're gonna make this right with you no matter what we have to do
