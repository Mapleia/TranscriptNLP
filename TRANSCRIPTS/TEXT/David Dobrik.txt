hey guys it's david um i want to come on here real quick and address some conversations that have been going on on the internet um i you know i've made over 600 videos and i've made a bunch of tick tocks vines instagram stories tweets the whole thing um and i'm obsessed with what i do i love being able to make people happy for a living and that's all that i want to do that being said consent is something that's super super important to me whether i'm shooting with a friend or shooting with a stranger i always make sure that whatever the video i'm putting out i have the approval from that person and i also acknowledge that those times where a person can change their mind and they decide that they no longer want to be associated and no longer want to be in the video that i'm putting up and then i'll take the video down and there's also been moments where i've looked back on videos and i realized that these don't represent me anymore and they're hurtful to other people and i don't i don't want them up because i've grown you know as a content creator and as a person and i don't agree with some of the videos i've posted um with the seth situation i'm sorry to seth because i like i said i i just want to make videos where everybody in it you know whether you're participating or watching is enjoying and having a good time and i miss the mark with that one and i'm really sorry i truly truly am um and with with people in my life that i don't film with anymore um like dom and you know the other people that no longer film with i i chose to distance myself because i don't align with some of the actions and i don't i don't stand for any kind of misconduct and i i'm i was just i've been really disappointed by some of my friends and for that reason i've separated from a lot of them i think with any video i make my main purpose is to make people happy and and inspire people and i just i never want anything to get in the way of that and i'm sorry if i've let you down and things like that won't happen again and i learned from my mistakes um and i also believe that actions speak a lot louder than words and you know you can take my word for it i'm gonna change but i'll also show you and i'll prove to you that you know the mistakes i made before won't be happening again um but yeah that's it all right i love you guys i'll see you later
