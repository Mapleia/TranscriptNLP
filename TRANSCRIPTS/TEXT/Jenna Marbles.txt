all right so I get it feel like we're at a time where we are purging ourselves of anything and everything toxic and I'm being requested that I address things that I've done in my past I also get a lot of tweets from people that are saying like we love you you unproblematic Queen which always makes me uncomfortable because I'm a person those of you that are familiar with how long I've been on the internet know that that's not true that I've definitely done things in the past that weren't great and I'm not completely unproblematic and I've tried my best to grow up and to be a better person and first and foremost I want everyone to know that I've always been a two-way street and that anytime that you criticize me and tell me that you would like me to do better or to do something differently that I always try to do that and I try to make fun content inclusive content things that don't offend people or upset people and that's kind of where I am there's a couple things that people want me to address and apologize for and I'm happy to do that because what I want from the people that I support and that I like is to have accountability and to know that I'm supporting someone whose morals and values align with my own and yeah I there's things in my past I'm not proud of and I'm getting a lot of tweets from people saying why have you private adalah zone videos and I have spent a lot of the last few days private e almost all of my old content and I'm sorry if any of that holds any nostalgia for you but I'm literally not trying to put out negative things into the world I think there was a time when having all of my old content exists on the internet showed how much I have grown up as a person which I'm very proud of and I think now it's hard for that content to exist at all because I think people watch it and don't bother to look at when it was posted or you know care about what path I took to get to where I am it offends them now and if that's the case where people will watch something and be offended now I don't want it to exist so I private it a lot of my old content because I just don't want anyone to feel upset about anything I I don't want to contribute to that I don't want I don't care I don't care I just don't care I don't want someone to watch something and feel hurt or offended now for any reason at all the first two things that I would like to address is the fact that there are people that were offended that I did blackface as Nicki Minaj in 2011 and I'll show you the clip credibly crazy and embarrassing this is private it has been private for quite some time but it looks like this and I do just want to tell you that it was not my intention to do blackface this is the end of the video where I took my wig off I I don't know how else to say this but it doesn't matter because all that matters is that people were offended and it hurt them and for that I am so unbelievably sorry that this isn't okay and it hasn't existed on the internet for a long time because it's not okay and I haven't done anything remotely like that because I heard people say this is blackface and I don't like that and I I just would never want to put that into the so this has been private for a long time but I do want to tell you how unbelievably sorry I am if I ever offended you by posting this video or by doing this impression and that that was never my intention it's not okay it's shameful it's awful I wish it wasn't part of my past the next thing that I want to address okay this is also from 2011 a bad year for me in judgment apparently um this video is called bounce that dick this has also been made private I don't want to offend anyone I'm not interested in it I'm not interested in making anyone feel bad in case you haven't noticed here's a clip I won't play it for you hold on let me remind you so as you can see I said hey ching chong Ling Wong shake your King Kong ding dong that was racist I'm bad at rap songs it's awful it doesn't need to exist it's inexcusable it's not okay I'm I'm incredibly sorry if this offended you then now whenever it doesn't need to exist it shouldn't have existed I shouldn't have said that ever it's not cool it's not cute it's not okay and I'm embarrassed that I ever made that period I think say how like to apologize for is a video that I posted in 2012 and made private shortly thereafter this was one of the hardest years of my life and I made video they came across unbelievably slut-shaming and I'm sorry I I just up I ranted about girls that ran around and slept around and that's wrong I had a lot of internalized misogyny I feel like at that time in my life and I'm sorry if I ever offended you with the things that I said in that video that there has been private for a long time it does not reflect my attitude towards anyone in their bodies and I just I that's really been eating me up inside for a long time and I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry if I ever made you feel bad about yourself or your choices or anything there's no one demanding an apology uh for that video of me right now but I'm like just you know what put it on my tab here's another thing I'm sorry for it I'm also sorry for I used to make a lot of content about like what girls do and what guys do and I know at the time there are a lot of people that enjoyed those videos but I have private adalah cause I don't think that making jokes about your gender is funny and I know that there's a lot of people that struggle with their identity and that have varying fluid identities or anything and I just don't want content in the world that's like I don't know it just doesn't make sense you know it doesn't make sense it can be hurtful can be harmful and I don't want it there another thing I would like to address is when people tweet at me I can't believe you be friends with this person or follow this person that's racist or you know done these terrible things and the only thing I would like to say is that I'm I'm just a person trying to navigate the world the same way that you are so I don't always know what's right what's wrong with the truth is and I'm just trying my best if someone clearly with their own pasts but they're not proud of um I do just try to see people for who they are right now today and that they're not defined by their pasts and I understand I'm trying to do the same thing that you are and support and be friends of people that I'm proud of and that I love and I'm just know that I'm doing my best and I just I don't know you know I try to just do what I can and I'm not trying to let anyone down or hurt anyone or upset anyone I'm just not that being said I've profited a lot of metal content um I don't I don't want to hurt anyone I don't want to offend anyone I don't um case you guys haven't noticed there's no sponsors on this channel not trying to sell you anything like I'm literally just here to have a good time and I don't think I'm having a good time and it seems like maybe some other people aren't having a good time so for now I don't I just can't exist on this channel hopefully I've taken down anything that would upset someone and I hope you know that that's just not my intent that's not what I ever set out to do to hurt anyone's feelings or to make anyone feel bad um so I'm just I don't I don't want to be like upset well I say this so give me a sec so um I think I'm just going to move on from this channel for now um I don't know if that's rubber I don't know how long it's gonna be um I just I want to make sure that the things that I put into the world are not hurting anyone and yeah I'm just gonna stop for now wherever I don't know I'll probably take this video down because it's embarrassing and just let whatever just live and just be that's it I want to say thank you for your support for those of you that um care about me and have been watching me for a long time I appreciate it I want to hold myself accountable and and it's painful to do it and it's not fun at first and I'm ashamed of things I've done and said in my past but it's important and yeah I hope this felt like something that you needed to hear from me and I just I'm not sure that I want to continue doing stuff on this channel and I don't want to put anything out in the world it's gotta hurt anybody so I need to be done with this channel for now or forever I don't know so alright good talk see you guys
