this pandemic has absolutely taken a toll on all of our physical and mental well-beings you know whether you're a nurse a contractor a doctor or regretfully unemployed it's been a tough year we're socially isolated um it's politically charged divisive time it's tough and i think it's okay to say that that we're all struggling a bit i've spent this pandemic in new york um but a few weeks ago i went down to miami to my father's apartment and i want to talk to you about that trip because i learned a very important lesson that i want to discuss with you when i went down to miami my friend surprised me with a private boat as a belated birthday present and i was very grateful i was excited at the same time i was a little cautious and nervous because we're in the midst of a pandemic so i went on the cdc website and checked the guidance for wearing masks during water activities i checked the local boat capacity guidelines so we were well below that and then i started thinking about individual risk and that's something i talk to you guys quite frequently about i get questions like is it safe to go on a boat is it safe to fly is it safe to see my relatives and there's rarely a one-size-fits-all answer because risk is a spectrum so i looked at my own personal risk level i'm young i don't have health problems i live alone so i don't put anyone else at risk i'm going to be following the proper quarantine and testing protocols returning back to new york we're following all the testing boat capacity and travel guidelines so i thought for me this risk level was okay but even considering all that even considering following the rules as the guidelines that are set forth it doesn't matter i messed up i really did and i need to do better the reason i'm saying this is because of the impact of my trip the impact can harm the medical message that i've been delivering from the beginning of this pandemic that covid19 is serious that masks are a benign yet important measure to reduce the spread of covet 19 and that i take it very very seriously when i go to work i wear a mask when i walk bare i wear a mask when i exercise in the gym i wear a mask because it's truly truly important what's killing me most right now is like people leave negative comments and i i deserve that i'm accepting of that i messed up here it's true but when i see bad actors and conspiracy theorists try and use my situation to attack the legitimacy of covet 19 to downplay its risks to say masks don't work that kills me because it feels like i'm being used for nefarious purposes it's not true attack me don't attack the science don't attack the hard-working women and men of the cdc and the who they're doing research in order to keep you safe at home so the situation taught me a lot about impact what i need to do better how i need to understand that my actions carry real consequences and while i may be following rules and guidelines it's not enough to just think about that i have to think about the impact and the people that i'm saying sorry to right now are very specific people it's you who have supported me on this channel and been loyal viewers it's those healthcare providers on the front line who are caring for patients sick with kovid19 it's those people at home it's you at home who's done the right thing this entire time and sees me doing this i'm sorry i let you down what i can say is that i'm gonna strive to do better i'm a human i messed up here it's true i really did this has been a mistake that i'm learning from i'm working through i've taken the time for self-reflection i'm going to continue to do so i can't promise that i won't make another mistake again but what i can promise is that i'm going to continue to learn from my mistakes i will continue to be transparent and honest so that i can be a better doctor for my patients and to be a better human for my friends family and for you i love you guys thank you for watching and as always stay happy and healthy
