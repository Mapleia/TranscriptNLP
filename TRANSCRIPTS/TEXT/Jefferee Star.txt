what's up everybody welcome back to my channel now i've been silent for a very long time i know that's very rare for me i've taken a lot of time to do a lot of self-reflection now in the past i've been very guilty of speaking out of anger out of frustration out of my emotions i'm so quick to grab my phone and just say whatever is on my mind in that moment without ever really thinking the ramifications of my words my actions and for the first time in a very long time i'm really reflecting on my behavior and mine alone and i've come to a lot of realizations and it's been really important to actually understand everything that i was a part of that i did wrong and really start a new chapter for myself i've spent a lot of time realizing why i do certain things and why i do the things that i do and today there are no excuses a year ago i did a video called never doing this again and i meant that and 2020 has been really really crazy and i have added to the chaos when i filmed my video called never doing it again i meant every word in the video did i slip up am i human have i done some [ __ ] up things of course i have but at the end of the day today once again i will not be exposing anyone for everyone saying jeffrey's gonna be coming with their receipts and we all need to be get ready to forgive that is the opposite of who i am i know i'm dramatic i'm crazy at times i'm outspoken but at the end of the day that is not who i am and today i will not be sitting here showing a million text messages and all these things that allegedly are out there that that's not it i will not be entertaining it my lawyers are entertaining it behind the scenes but i will not be i know this may sound shocking coming from my mouth but when you accept that you are the problem you can become the solution and i've definitely put myself in the victim mentality before when i knew i was wrong and maybe that maybe i didn't want to admit it i wasn't ready to and i was too insecure but today there are no excuses i'm someone that has impulse control and i'm fully admitting my flaws and i hope that people can learn from me i have moments where i get fired up i don't think things through i don't think about how my actions will affect others while i'm saying them and when you speak from your emotions without fully processing something it is one of the most unhealthy things and that is a very major problem of mine a lot of people want me to address this situation and a lot of people were putting a time stamp like jeffrey you need to speak on this right now and i think that we live in a world where people are just so used to doing what people want right away and that's not good either i think it's been very important to stay off of social media i haven't been on in weeks i've read anything i haven't clicked a video i haven't seen anything and it's been really about finding myself again and remembering why i'm here and and how my actions can affect other people and everyone around me i know there's a lot of people waiting for me to address the situation now i didn't try to take anyone down i'm not a villain in a movie this isn't a netflix series with a crazy storyline i know it sounds like it and trust me i'm sure i'd watch it as well but this is my real life and a lot of things that are happening and being said are false when someone else tries to take someone else down or their career and it doesn't work you can't just take a few more down with you that's not how life works we have to all take accountability for our own actions and no one else's and that's what i will continue to do and if i don't please [ __ ] remind me now i know that i've had a very hard time doing that in the past and that will not be happening again now did i mix myself up in drama did i speak on things i shouldn't have uh speak on of course i did did i believe certain things instead of asking the source did i get caught up in the hype did i do dumb [ __ ] and did i not just simply call james charles and ask questions myself 100 and that is my fault i would like to personally apologize to james charles for the words that i've said and for my actions if i was really close with someone i should have had the ability to just simply call them and ask and say hey these were the things that were being said to me instead i didn't i let people really gasp me up get me going behind the scenes and i really fell for a lot of things and i got caught up in the hype it's disgusting it's awful and none of it should have happened so james i am truly sorry for my actions and my behavior 2020 has been very tumultuous for a lot of us it has been a very crazy year and i think that james and myself and anyone involved would agree with me that there are way bigger issues happening on this planet i know that some people may jeffrey you're just saying this as a distraction jeffrey no reality is here and makeup drama and beauty community gossip and tea it may be entertainment for you and it used to be for me but it's my life and it's their lives and right now outside of our walls our world is falling apart and it's truly shocking so i'm not going to give you an expose of the beauty community i'm not going to end anyone today i've never blackmailed anyone in my life i've never committed a crime before and i've never been to jail it's been hard to process a lot of what is being said but involving the situation i would just like to say that james charles i'm very sorry anything else that you guys want to know it will never be spoken about you can ask other people i just like last year have fully removed myself and did i get swept up into the [ __ ] again of course i did and for that i'm forever embarrassed of now brianna taylor still has no justice black trans women are being murdered every day and the news is silent elijah mcclain has no justice and the countless other people who are murdered every single day while everyone just goes about their business like nothing's happening and i think that drama and the beauty world which i have definitely been a part of it all has to stop now six months ago before covid and everything hit our world it was such a different place for all of us and including myself it's really time to reflect on the big picture now shane dawson he is one of my best friends and someone who helped me remember who i am when i was starting to crack and lose focus of who i really was he is genuine amazing he is selfless and he is one of the most kind people that i've ever met in my entire world i know that shane would put his family and friends before himself in a flash now did shane and i get caught up in the drama and do some dumb [ __ ] of course we did but that is my best friend and i was actually truly shocked that people thought that i was going to distance myself from him or that my silence was anything but support i know shane from now i don't know shane from 10 years ago and he doesn't know me from 10 years ago now do i agree with shane's past actions of course i don't and does he agree with bypassed behavior of course he doesn't i know the amazing person that he is today and you don't abandon your friends i know a lot of people have said jeffrey you've had a lot of tumultuous friendships in the beauty world yes i 100 have but in reality i have a lot of amazing real people behind the scenes and i'm forever grateful for those people who always remind me of who i am because lately i definitely was slipping now what me and shane accomplish together business-wise i hope that it inspires anyone out there that wants to start a business that is an entrepreneur or who is afraid to get off their feet because remember i used to be homeless and work at the mall and i really just said you know what i want to create my own vision and that's what i did and he has always believed in me all right now no matter what narrative anyone tries to spin of me i am so [ __ ] proud to own an inclusive makeup company since i opened my doors in 2014 i have created products for everyone any product shade or formula i've created has worked for any race gender and most importantly i want you guys to remember that all beauty matters and from the very first ad of my company i have always shown people of color and anyone no matter what size your body are or what gender you are you are accepted in jeffree star cosmetics i know a lot of people try to deter from my message and sometimes i have to turn it myself through negativity and drama but that won't be happening anymore i will always use my platform and my voice for good now i remember when brands were making 10 concealers and 15 foundation shades and they thought that that was correct i remember speaking up very loudly to my peers and other people in this industry saying that it was wrong and i got a lot of [ __ ] for it but i always stick up for what's right and i always will when huge corporations have stolen from small brands i was the first one to speak up very loudly now sometimes it can be misconstrued for drama or tea or being sarcastic but the message was always that no you have to do right in this industry and that's what i'll always stand by now i just want to say thank you to everyone out there who has been supporting me dming me messaging me and just showing so much love i know that sometimes it's not popular to be a fan of me to be my friend but it has been so much for all the rider dies and the millions of people who have just been waiting for me to come back um just know that it has been very important to actually self-reflect and not just grab my phone and say whatever i'm feeling in that moment this has been me silent for a reason i've been really really working on myself and i definitely was distracted there's also been a lot of things going on in my personal life which will never be excuses and i'm not going to talk about them today but just know that we're all human beings and we're all going through a lot what is next you guys know jeffree star cosmetics will never be slowing down and i'm so excited for everything that is coming for the rest of 2020 i know that the makeup world is changing the beauty community is shifting and kovit has transformed our entire world but what's coming next is one of my most exciting projects ever and i can't wait um august is going to be very exciting if you've made it this far thank you so much for watching and listening to my words and thank you for allowing me to have time to articulate my thoughts and not just upload a video out of emotions i will be back very soon with new videos new makeup tutorials and of course new products so thank you guys so much for watching this and i will see you soon mwah
