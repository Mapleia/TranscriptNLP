hey guys it's uh the morning it's tuesday and i just thought i'd check in here i am just i'm overwhelmed by the amount of backlash i obviously i put out that video and in no way did i think i would get so much backlash and hate and um a ton a ton of hate from the lgbt q plus community and it that alone breaks my heart so much because i just i never would want to offend that community that i've been so like for and admired and loved and allied with for so long and especially the transgender community um i haven't watched gigi's video but gigi called me yesterday and i just lost i just broke down because um i was already getting so much backlash and uh and she was so sweet and she told me you know so many people are texting me and like i'm gonna make a video and stuff but i i support you you know she said i haven't watched your video because i can't really watch things i just checked twitter and instagram and even that i shouldn't check and just i support you because i've supported you i've supported her through everything as i support anyone going through anything you know and um i just lost it i lost it because i haven't told anyone in my life these feelings i mean a few people but not a lot because because of the judgment of the backlash it's not something patrick star tweeted me and said like are you are you i think stupid just because i put on a wig and nails and makeup i just it doesn't mean i'm a girl a woman i just play dress up and that's fine and i get that and yes what i did last week i was playing dress up for a music video was playing dress up for a role that's not what i was saying is because i did that i was like now i'm a man this is something that i have that i have just felt since i was five six seven um it's something that i've been in therapy sorry my phone so i've got a phone call i have a gender identity therapist that um i've been talking to for the past six months um because the thing is is i never would have said i was transgender before i i never would have said those words because because i do have boobs and i do have a vagina so that of course to most people makes me a woman um and i've talked with him and i was like well i don't think i'm non-binary i really in my heart you know feel male he told me not every transgender transitions and sorry so much i have so much anxiety over this it just because of all the things i've done i've obviously trolled in the past and i've obviously said stuff that i don't mean or i don't stand by this is something that i've so strongly stand by and i felt like you know what i come out with this because i feel like there's a lot of people and maybe there's not a lot but i've got a few tms from people who say i also struggle with gender identity and it's and at first years ago i have a clip i'll see if i can find it saying that i wasn't transgender but i wanted to identify as non-binary and for me that was easier to say and easier for people to accept to say well i don't identify with any gender but that's not true i identify as a male okay too i don't know it's so hard because i've been through therapy for the past six months over this i've been through talking i talked about this over and over and it's just because like i i don't look like a male but i'm i'm just not and people just telling me i'm not transgender and i guess i haven't watched chidi's video um but when she when she called me she's like you know no one can tell you you're not transgender you know and i i feel like i should just apologize so people just stop being nasty to me because this is something that's really that i really struggled with as a as a child i hated my breasts i hated my vagina i hated going into the female bathroom i hated being classified as female i hated being told to play with like barbies and stuff like that i know a lot of people might be like okay that's not that's a tomboy or something and i don't know how to fully explain just like not hatred but or the utter like it's like i don't know how to describe it other than like i feel like prisoner in my own body and i kind of always have i've always kind of changed it up trying to think maybe if i'm more this way i'll love my body more maybe from this way or maybe if i go ultra ultra feminine that'll make me feel like a girl and and it just never it just never happened for me and i'm sorry if i offend people with my language and the way i said things i'm so new to all this i'm so new to it i i just never really talked about it before this year other than like except with my therapist i've never i've never really looked into it and i know i've just always been attracted to you know i'm not saying like sexually attracted but like i've always been drawn to the transgender community in the movement because i just admired them and i just loved they could just be out and open in people like applauded them and i just thought like as long as i had boobs and stuff like that that i i would never be accepted as transgender and that's just how it is i mean it started early on when i said that i was bisexual people like no you're not i know maybe i created this for myself that when i used to troll years and years and years ago people just get nothing seriously and that's i guess just something i have to deal with but i just hate having to like hide something because i am so open online and i feel for the past couple years i've been very honest and open and when i do my shows so many people are like thank you for being open thank you for being honest and the more i've heard this i was like well maybe i need to be honest about this because it's something that i struggle with and i'm sorry if my confusion or my vocabulary discredits me in any way but i'm not picky i i would never i could never mock a community that i've loved and that has loved me has been so open and accepting to me i would never mock them i would never do a disservice to myself can you imagine can you imagine i mean it's not like this is not the end of the world dating or whatever but like why would i do a disservice to myself you know i want to find love and i want to find happiness do you know how hard that is to be like that video on my channel so many people criticizing me for my title and yes i could change the title and guess what it'd probably be easier for me to because if i ever date someone in the future be a guy or a girl and they see i'm transgender guess what i hate to say this but a lot of people aren't judgmental and they would i've had i've had people tell me to my face i haven't been out with this but i've had people tell me oh my gosh like are you are you are you sure you're naturally born female and stuff like that like it's it's just the harsh reality and i know that's mean and it's hurtful to hear and it's it's hard for me to hear when people would tell me like oh my gosh like are you sure you're a woman like there's so many people on on bumble that are trans and don't tell you and stuff so imagine them looking me up and seeing this like i have to explain it i have to explain it and i'm okay to explain that but at the same time i'm like maybe my life would just be easier let me just take the shell that i'm in let me just i look like a female to you i act like a female to you let me just let me just say that i'm a female and just continue being unhappy and honestly that's where i'm at right now and i'm so sorry if i asked anyone but jesus was just saying like are you stupid you're offensive and i said this person a dm back i said a lot of people dms back i'm like how can you tell me who i am and what i am on the inside like how how can you tell me that you haven't grown up you haven't been with my struggles mentally it just sucks i did one answering like assumptions yesterday or answering questions of like what offended you about the video and it just didn't come across the way i wanted to and i know this isn't going to cross my way because no matter how hard i try there's no way i can just sit here and convince you guys like this is this is who i am and it just it just it just sucks i just don't understand like i just thought anything i'd be like you know what i'll say this and i'll get support and i know i'll get a little backlash but i just don't understand how i just don't get how people think i could choose this but i'm just deciding to do this i can't apologize like for who i am and like how i feel and it sucks that i we live in this world and i i just i'm just not allowed to identify as a man because of how i look the same way people dress up in wigs and stuff like that and makeup but they're still a boy i mean that's how i feel i dress up in wigs and makeup but i'm still a boy too and it's just it's just so it's like triggering it's ptsd i'm just like when i've said that i was like bisexual because i have i have come out as all gay before too as lesbian you know i thought i was you know it's just i'm so scared i'm just so scared of everything of judgment backlash and not i'm not talking about the internet although it's just all crashing down on me but i'm talking about in real life too and i can't explain it unless you have gone through it as well like i said i've got a few dms of people who struggle with the same thing but i'm sorry i literally have like just so much i'm just what i was saying too with like last week just dressing up in a in a costume it felt good to have somewhat of a positive reaction to an outer appearance of how i feel inside i was so scared for so long to like tell people like hey i've i've been a male since i can remember and i felt like more comfortable and it was like it was a way to like ease it out you know without even knowing that that's what it would trigger just like a comfortability and a piece with with who i am and it is something like i said i've struggled with for so so long i actually have a therapist women tomorrow and so i don't know maybe something i need to talk about and figure it out and maybe i should figure it out like just privately i guess i just thought maybe i could help someone who also deals with the same kind of thoughts i do and other transgenders who haven't transitioned you know i mean there's so many that i've talked with um that haven't transitioned or can't afford a transition or don't want to transition and when you've been in a body for so long it's it's like scary like i said i've seen the backlash of i'm just using this because it's such a public example like caleb who's like 60 and transitioned at 16 and getting so much backlash and hate and jokes and stuff and you know she makes jokes too but it's like you know you wait 60 years to be the person you want to be and it's like and then i've talked to people who detransitioned and you know that also also scares me for me personally like do i wanna what do i wanna do what do i what do i wanna identify as especially because i've been this person for so long on the internet but i just know like i my story and my truth isn't too is it meant to like offend anyone i didn't think it would i wasn't talking about anyone but myself and um and for that i apologize because that hurts my heart more than me not being able to be myself it hurts me more that i would hurt other people that have been able to be themselves like like every show i go to i always get questions about lgbt and like all of that i didn't realize i didn't realize like i had such a support for that community so i guess in a way it kind of just made me feel more open to talk about how deeply i relate and how much i connect like more than just being an ally being supportive which i am but i just i feel part of the community without being a part of the community because nobody wants me in it and i will say like i said i haven't watched the video i don't know what she said in the video but i will say she was so sweet i just had it a breakdown especially you know she called me on the phone and you know especially to her it's i've loved gigi for so long since the beginning and for her to like be open and supportive to me it's really really amazing i mean she knows me in real life so i get it and she was one who educated me about being like you know there's no such thing as fully transitioned like being fully transgender you're transgender no matter what that's what you said like no one can tell you and that's where again i i i apologize so deeply if my language was like offensive or wrong by saying like fully transitioned not just like transgender as transgender and like again i'm not i'm not fully educated on it and but the way she was able to tell me that and like the way she told me i support you and she was i just want you to think this is what stood out to me and i'm receptive of that i can learn from that but to be like you're freaking stupid and like this is not a joke and like it's like i'm just a joke because of how i look i'm just i look female so i'm a joke for b for identifying as a male anyways [Applause] it just sucks because i feel like i should i'm apologizing i just want to apologize because it took so long for me to get to this point i just i just wasn't i i just wasn't expecting so much hate especially from this community that i like loved and like respected and admired just wanted so badly to be included in all in all of it okay
