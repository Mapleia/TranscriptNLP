hello everyone james charles here and today i'm going to be making a very important video about a very important topic as many of you guys know about two years ago now i was involved with a very public online scandal in which some fellow youtubers made some very serious accusations against me and within the past couple of weeks similar accusations are being made again and i think it's very important that i get on camera and talk to you guys honestly about what is going on uh when this first happened two years ago i uploaded a video to my channel called no more lies and that video was a very planned video it focused on receipts and screenshots and defending myself in the situation but i want you guys to know that this video that i'm going to be making today is going to be nothing like no more lies uh this is not exactly planned i don't have a script i will let you guys know that i do have just some notes in front of me of points that i want to make because this is a very very serious topic but today's video is going to be from the heart and i'm going to focus on what happened the conclusions that i've come to and most importantly holding myself accountable for my own actions first and foremost i need to say sorry i owe a massive apology to anybody that i've hurt or anybody that i've made uncomfortable with my actions and i also want to say i'm sorry to my friends family and fans that have to watch another one of these videos because you shouldn't have to and this is really really embarrassing uh when this all started online a few weeks ago it sparked a large conversation and many people have shared their thoughts and opinions and i want to take some time to address literally everything in today's video but before doing that i want to make it really really clear that i fully understand my actions and how they are wrong uh there's no excuse for them and i don't plan on making any in this video either and i hope that you will choose to watch it all the way through um i also just want to make a quick note as well that i'm filming this on the night of march 31st it is currently 12 54 in the morning i'm alone here in the studio and i know that when i upload this tomorrow it is going to be april fool's day which is awful timing because this video and this topic is not a joke in any way shape or form uh and i don't want anybody to think that it is but i also don't want to wait any longer to speak about this i want you guys to know that this is very very important to me and i'm taking this very very seriously uh the last thing that i want to say before i just get into it is that i think it's important that i provide a trigger warning for this video uh there's gonna be topics and things talked about that are very very sensitive uh to some people and i don't want anybody to have to listen to those if they don't want to so i'm just letting you know right now but with all that said i think it's time that we talk in case anybody isn't aware of what's going on within the past couple of weeks two different people both under the age of 18 have recently come forward saying that they had inappropriate messages with me on social media uh one of them being from last year and one of them being from more recent in both of these cases i added these people on snapchat asked how old they were right away was told that they were 18 believed them engaged in authority conversation and then later on found that they were actually 16. upon finding out i was immediately embarrassed and blocked both people later on when i saw them making videos about it and those videos going viral my immediate reaction completely honestly was to be really really upset i wanted to get on camera and film another no more live video where i gather all my receipts and all my screenshots and try to tell my side of the story and then just move on from the situation and now looking back that was so stupid because as i did more research on these topics and self-reflected i realized that the receipts and the screenshots and the sys and the specific details of the interaction really don't matter because i [ __ ] up and i needed to take accountability for my actions and most importantly apologize to the people that were affected by them these conversations should have never happened point-blank period there's no excuse for it there's no if ands or buts and i take full responsibility for that i trusted the information that was given to me rather than the information i could have and should have gotten myself in both of these situations doing research into these people's public social media profiles would have revealed their true ages and therefore these conversations would have never happened in the first place but i didn't do the research and that is what is so embarrassing um as an adult it is my job and my responsibility to verify who i'm talking to and therefore there is no one to blame for this other than myself um to the guys involved with this situation i want to say i'm sorry i'm sorry that i ought to do i'm sorry that i flirted with you and i'm really sorry if i ever made you uncomfortable it is completely unacceptable i was being reckless and after looking back and finally realizing that this was my own fault i started doing a lot of thinking and reflecting to really try and figure out why i was actually allowing myself to be so reckless in the first place in all other areas of my life my friends my business i like to think of myself as pretty put together and on top of things and i couldn't understand why relationships were the one outlier why were they not working why was this area of me so different and i finally finally came to a conclusion it sucks and it is ridiculously embarrassing to admit this but i think i have to and that is that i'm desperate i do understand that with these videos coming to light it's really starting to not even starting it's really looking period like i'm actively searching for younger people to be in a relationship with and i just want to say firsthand that that is absolutely not the case my hope has always been to be in a relationship with somebody around my age or older that i can relate to and that can make me laugh and unfortunately i've not been able to find that person yet but the idea of actually being in a relationship became so important to me that i was willing to trust too quickly miss out on red flags and most importantly not take the precautionary measures that really anybody but especially somebody with a public platform should be taking before talking to anybody and there's no excuse for that when i've watched videos in the past of people talking about serious topics such as this one it's always really bothered me when people would talk about conclusions or changes that they're going to make without actually talking about how they got there in the first place so i think it's really important that i do that in this video i just honestly think that i owe it to you guys to kind of walk you through the reflection that i've been doing um so you know that i'm taking this seriously how i came to terms with my desperation and how it led me here in 2019 my dating life became even more public than it already was when i was called out and labeled as a predator you guys i feel like at this point i'll know the story so i don't want to go back into details but pretty much i had to get on camera and prove that i was being lied to i had all the receipts to back it up but at the time i also recognized that i definitely needed to change the way i was going about dating because clearly something was not working um and in that video i made a vow and a promise to myself and to you guys as the audience that i will be way more careful moving forward and that promise was not one that i kept i'm gonna be honest with you guys at the time that i posted no more lies i really thought that like the only issue was kind of like the straight guys and being lied to um but i now realized that it was obviously a much deeper problem and i really wish that at that time i had spent the time to sit down look at myself in the mirror and try to get to the root of the problem and understand why i was actually allowing myself to get into these situations instead of just brushing it off and saying like it's the straight guys and it's the line but like i said i didn't and as time progressed my desire for relationship never really went away and i slowly started ignoring red flags again and also ignoring my friends and the important people around me that warned me that i was going to get hurt and to them i also feel like i really owe an apology because i should have listened and i feel like if i did we probably wouldn't be here today looking back now and just trying to do my best to piece this all together in my head i think that my lack of experience when it came to dating growing up and then all of a sudden having a lot of attention from different types of men some for good reasons and some for bad reasons really affected me in ways that i didn't quite understand um i honestly just thought that i had really really bad luck and that i was being taken advantage of when that wasn't the case at all and i had the mentality that i could reach out to literally anybody and use my explore page and for you page as a dating app and eventually i would just happen to find the right person but that's just not how dating works literally at all uh it's gross it's weird and it's desperation i just really thought it was important to share my thought process and the conversations that i've been having with myself and professionals behind the scenes in order to help myself fully understand the situation so i could properly hold myself accountable for how i got here in the first place when these videos started to come to light power imbalance became a really large topic of conversation on social media and rightfully so in 2019 when i had my whole situation i was accused of abusing my fame money and power to get what i wanted and when i responded to that at the time i said that that was disgusting and then i would never want to do that and to this day i still stand behind that sentiment one thousand percent so when it was getting brought up again i got really really frustrated and was trying to understand because i was thinking to myself like okay i know that this situation shouldn't have happened i know that i this conversation shouldn't have occurred i take responsibility for that but at the same time like they dm'd you first they lied to you they flirted first like you didn't use your fame money and power to get anything but i've now realized that that mentality is completely raw because the power imbalance can happen even when it's not intentional what i wasn't getting before is that the excitement that comes with talking to a celebrity is literally enough to make somebody do or say something that they normally wouldn't even if that celebrity isn't intentionally weaponizing their fame money or power and that's the concept that i just wasn't getting but i now do even though i'm able to turn off my social media and just talk to somebody outside of the spotlight about something normal in normal clothes and no makeup on as james dickinson that doesn't change the fact that to them i'm still james charles and that's something that i can't turn off for me having a public platform has become such a huge part of my life that at this point it does feel normal but i have to understand that to 99.9 of people it's not normal and will never be normal and that's where the power and balance lies that i wasn't understanding but i'm so glad that i finally do because like i said in 2019 taking advantage of that power imbalance is something that i would never ever want to do but unintentionally was with this situation blowing up there are a lot of people speaking about this online whether it be sharing their opinions arguing back and forth or most importantly holding me accountable for my actions i understand that posting this video today is not going to stop those conversations but it's going to spark more of them and that's something that i am completely okay with because i really feel like these are topics that we need to be speaking about a lot more i also want to make it clear too that through uploading this video today my hope and my expectations are not to you know press post and then forget about it and move on and wash my hands as if nothing happened because something did happen and what happened was not okay and i don't want to just forget about it um i should have been more careful in every single way when it comes to the ways that i was looking for a relationship i didn't do the proper research and for that i'm once again ashamed and embarrassed i can't take it back as much as i wish that i could but i am really really glad that i now fully understand the situation so i'm able to do better in the future and i really hope to show that to you guys i'm a firm believer that when scandals or situations like this happen you can get on camera and upload an apology video where you say sorry a million times all day long but the only way to actually show and prove that you are sorry is through action and change and i'm going to change this whole situation has been so embarrassing and i'm ashamed but like i said i'm now educated and fully understand what went on and i'm making a promise to all of you right now on camera that i will be way more careful moving forward with every single person that i speak to my for you page and explore page are not dating apps and i will stop treating them as if they are i also have already started asking for proper identification from every single guy that has either reached out or that i was speaking to and will continue doing so for the rest of time i now understand the root of the problem i understand how and why i and only i caused myself to get into this situation i understand that this could have and should have been easily avoided and i also understand that i need to be aware of my platform at all times i didn't understand how a situation like this could affect the people involved but now i do and for that to the victims i am so so sorry and i promise that something like this will never ever happen again i also feel like i owe an apology to my friends family team members and also fans that had to watch this all go down again to all of you guys i once again wish that i had listened earlier on um you guys saw this and i didn't and i'm really really sorry for not taking that seriously and not being a better person and a better role model like i promised that i would be i'm going to be taking some time away to reflect and further educate myself on these topics i think at this point it's really important that i do so so i'm able to follow through with my word and prove to you guys that i will be a better person even though i won't be here posting i do want people to know that i will still be here available listening and learning at this point if you made it all the way through the video i really appreciate it and just wanted to say thank you for listening and i hope to never disappoint you again see you soon
